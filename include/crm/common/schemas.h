 * \brief Update CIB XML to most recent schema version
 *
 * "Update" means either actively employ XSLT-based transformation(s)
 * (if intermediate product to transform valid per its declared schema version,
 * transformation available, proceeded successfully with a result valid per
 * expectated newer schema version), or just try to bump the marked validating
 * schema until all gradually rising schema versions attested or the first
 * such attempt subsequently fails to validate.   Which of the two styles will
 * be used depends on \p transform parameter (positive/negative, respectively).
 *
 * \param[in,out] xml_blob   XML tree representing CIB, may be swapped with
 *                           an "updated" one
 * \param[out]    best       The highest configuration version (per its index
 *                           in the global schemas table) it was possible to
 *                           reach during the update steps while ensuring
 *                           the validity of the result; if no validation
 *                           success was observed against possibly multiple
 *                           schemas, the value is less or equal the result
 *                           of \c get_schema_version applied on the input
 *                           \p xml_blob value (unless that function maps it
 *                           to -1, then 0 would be used instead)
 * \param[in]     max        When \p transform is positive, this allows to
 *                           set upper boundary schema (per its index in the
 *                           global schemas table) beyond which it's forbidden
 *                           to update by the means of XSLT transformation
 * \param[in]     transform  Whether to employ XSLT-based transformation so
 *                           as to allow overcoming possible incompatibilities
 *                           between major schema versions (see above)
 * \param[in]     to_logs    If true, output notable progress info to
 *                           internal log streams; if false, to stderr
 *
 * \return \c pcmk_ok if no non-recoverable error encountered (up to
 *         caller to evaluate if the update satisfies the requirements
 *         per returned \p best value), negative value carrying the reason
 *         otherwise
